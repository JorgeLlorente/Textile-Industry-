# Performance on textile industry

## Purpose of the project

This project tries to shed light on how the machines of a textile company perform in a daily basis.

## Context of the project

The main income from this company comes from the production of tissue for mattresses. This company has evolved towards digitalization and it has hired a program to document every movement of the machines. One and a half year later, this data is going to be used to determine whether machines and the operators are performing well or not. In order to do this, one of the managers of the company has a meeting all Mondays with the production department to analyse the performance of these machines during the last week. To do so, this project solves this task using Tableau in order to automate the process of downloading the data and creating interesting and clear graphs to answer questions that the client needs to solve.
